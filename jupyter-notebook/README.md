## jupyter-notebook Folder

This folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file for interactive exploration and experimentation with the MNIST image classification project.

### `handwritten-digit-classification.ipynb`

This Jupyter Notebook provides an interactive environment where you can:

* **Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset:** Explore the data, visualize sample images, and perform necessary transformations.
* **Build and compile the neural network model:** Define the model's architecture, choose an optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
* **Train the model:** Execute the training process and monitor the model's performance.
* **Evaluate the trained model:** Calculate metrics like accuracy and loss on the test dataset.
* **Generate predictions:** Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
* **Visualize results:** Create plots to understand the model's predictions, including visual comparisons of correct and incorrect classifications, and probability distributions of individual predictions.
* **Experiment with different parameters:** Modify the model's architecture, training settings, and hyperparameters to optimize performance.
* **Document your steps:** Add text cells to explain your code, document your findings, and create a comprehensive record of your exploration.

By utilizing this Jupyter Notebook, you can gain a deeper understanding of the MNIST image classification problem, explore different approaches to solve it, and document your journey in a clear and organized manner.
