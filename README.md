# Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow
 This repository is based on a guided project focused on Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow, hosted by the Coursera Project Network. Participants will delve into the essentials of utilizing Keras with TensorFlow to address image classification tasks. Through hands-on exercises spanning approximately 2 hours, learners will construct, train, and assess neural network models capable of accurately discerning hand-written digits. The project equips participants with foundational insights into neural networks, TensorFlow, and Keras, enabling them to tackle classification challenges with confidence.

This repository contains code for a project-based course on Basic Image Classification with Keras and TensorFlow hosted by Coursera Project Network.

In this project, participants learn the basics of using Keras with TensorFlow as its backend and how to apply it to solve a basic image classification problem. By the end of this 2-hour long project, participants create, train, and evaluate a Neural Network model capable of predicting digits from hand-written images with a high degree of accuracy. They also gain understanding of the fundamentals of Neural Networks, TensorFlow, and Keras.
