# Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow
 This repository is based on a guided project focused on Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow, hosted by the Coursera Project Network. Participants will delve into the essentials of utilizing Keras with TensorFlow to address image classification tasks. Through hands-on exercises spanning approximately 2 hours, learners will construct, train, and assess neural network models capable of accurately discerning hand-written digits. The project equips participants with foundational insights into neural networks, TensorFlow, and Keras, enabling them to tackle classification challenges with confidence.
