# Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow

This repository contains code for a guided project focused on Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow, hosted by the Coursera Project Network.

## Project Overview

The project is structured into several stages, each addressing a specific aspect of image classification with TensorFlow:

1. **Encode the Labels**: Encoding the labels for the image dataset.

2. **Understand Neural Networks**: Gaining an understanding of neural networks, their architecture, activation functions, and how they learn to perform image classification tasks.

3. **Preprocess Image Examples**: Applying image preprocessing techniques to the dataset, including resizing, normalization, and encoding labels.

4. **Create a Neural Network Model**: Creating the architecture of the neural network model using TensorFlow, including defining the layers, activation functions, loss function, and optimizer.

5. **Train the Model to Fit the Dataset**: Training the neural network model on the preprocessed dataset to learn patterns and associations between input images and their corresponding labels.

6. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using a separate test dataset, computing evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

7. **Visualize the Predictions**: Visualizing the predictions made by the trained model on sample images from the test dataset to inspect the model's performance and compare predicted labels with ground truth labels.

## Setup

To run the code in this repository, follow these steps:
